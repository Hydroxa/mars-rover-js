          NASA's Curiosity is the largest and most advanced rover ever sent to
          Mars. The car-sized rover is part of NASA's Mars Science Laboratory
          (MSL). Curiosity's ongoing mission is to study the ancient
          habitability and the potential for life on Mars.

        <p>
          Opportunity was the second of the two rovers launched in 2003 to land
          on Mars and begin traversing the Red Planet in search of signs of
          ancient water.
        </p>
        <h2> What was Spirit?</h2>
        <div className="SpiritPic">
          <img src="\Spirit.jpg" alt="Spirit picture"/>
        </div>
        <p>
          NASA's Spirit rover—and it's twin Opportunity—studied the history of
          climate and water at sites on Mars where conditions may once have been
          favorable to life.
        </p>
        <ul>
          Spirit uncovered strong evidence that Mars was once much wetter than
          it is now. Described as a "wonderful workhorse"—Spirit operated for 6
          years, 2 months, and 19 days, more than 25 times its original intended
          lifetime. The rover traveled 4.8 miles (7.73 kilometers) across the
          Martian plains. On May 25, 2011, NASA ended efforts to contact the
          marooned rover and declared its mission complete. The rover had been
          silent since March 2010.
